      <summary>Name is not visible on one of my PANs. What's wrong?</summary>
      <p>
        Nothing's wrong. The name will appear automatically once you check an
        allotment with status <strong>Allotted</strong> or
        <strong>Not Allotted</strong> with that PAN.

        Incorrect name is visible on one of my PANs. Why? How can I correct it?
      </summary>
      <p>
        <strong>If you're applying using net banking,</strong> it may be due to
        demat/bank mismatch. In this case, name is taken from your demat account
        while PAN is taken from your bank account.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>If you're applying using third party apps like Narada,</strong>
        it may be due to demat/PAN mismatch. In this case, the name is taken
        from your demat account while the PAN is what you linked that demat to
        on these apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        To correct it, you'll need to email mentioning your PAN and the correct
        name on the email address mentioned above. Also, you may want to correct
        one of these mappings (whichever applies in your case) for it to not
        happen again. It is also one of the reasons for no allotment.
