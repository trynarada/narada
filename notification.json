    "body": "Hi, there seems to be an issue while checking allotments for Shivalic Power Control Limited where the allotment status is inadvertently being displayed as Not Applied. Note that this is the status that is coming to Narada from the registrar (Skyline) and hence your best option to check the real status would be to rely on messages and emails from your banks and brokers. Thanks!"
